## Introduction

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Systems project! This project aims to build a personalized movie recommendation system that provides users with tailored movie suggestions based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have implemented various recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach that combines both. Here's an overview of the key components:

## Data Collection

We collected movie ratings and metadata from the MovieLens dataset, which contains a vast collection of movie ratings from users.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building recommendation models, we cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, such as the distribution of movie ratings and user preferences.

## Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a powerful technique that recommends items based on user behavior and preferences. We implemented collaborative filtering using matrix factorization (SVD) and evaluated its performance.

### User-Item Matrix

We created a user-item matrix that represents user ratings for movies, providing the foundation for collaborative filtering.

### Matrix Factorization (SVD)

We applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the user-item matrix, enabling us to make personalized movie recommendations.

### Evaluation

We evaluated the collaborative filtering model's performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Using Surprise Library

We leveraged the Surprise library to perform collaborative filtering and optimize hyperparameters.

### Load Data

We loaded the data into Surprise's format and prepared it for model training.

### Gridsearch with SVD

We conducted a grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the SVD model, enhancing recommendation quality.

### Best Model Selection

We selected the best-performing SVD model and trained it on the dataset for personalized recommendations.

## Content-Based Recommendations

Content-based filtering recommends items based on their features, such as movie genres and tags.

### Feature Extraction

We used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract features from movie titles, genres, and tags, converting text data into numerical representations.

### Calculating Similarity

We calculated cosine similarity between movies based on their TF-IDF features, enabling us to find similar movies.

### Function for Movie Recommendations

We created a function that takes a movie title as input and returns a list of recommended movies based on their similarity to the input movie.

## Hybrid Recommendation System

A hybrid recommendation system combines collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations for enhanced suggestions.

### Combining Recommendations

We combined recommendations from both models with equal weight to create a hybrid approach.

### Scoring and Sorting

We assigned scores to each recommended movie and sorted them in descending order to provide top recommendations.

### User-Specific Recommendations

Our hybrid system offers user-specific recommendations, tailoring suggestions based on individual user preferences.

## Conclusion

In this movie recommendation systems project, we have successfully implemented collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach. These techniques offer users personalized movie recommendations, enhancing their viewing experience.

## Future Improvements

While our system is operational, there is room for improvement. Future enhancements may include incorporating user feedback, implementing real-time recommendation updates, and refining content-based features.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions in the project repository to set up the environment and explore the code.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Python libraries, including Surprise, NumPy, and pandas. Refer to the project documentation for a complete list of dependencies.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the MovieLens dataset for providing valuable movie ratings and metadata for this project.
